# Continuous-Bernoulli-VAE

Reproducing the paper "The continuous Bernoulli: fixing a pervasive error in variational autoencoders" for the NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility Challenge

We aim to replicate the experiments described in the paper ["The continuous Bernoulli: fixing a pervasive error in variational autoencoders"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxViBSgLB) from the NeurIPS 2019 submissions, as part of our participation in the  [NeurIPS Reproducibility Challenge 2019](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/).

## Description
